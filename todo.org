** TODO Set3 type to clean up and/or speed up the fromVertexForm code ?

I wonder if we can clean up and/or speed up the fromVertexForm code by
having a specific Set3 type that stores at least three elements. Since
every vertex should have at least (and probably often also exactly)
three definers, this could clean up some of the code. (We have a few
"there should be at least three items here" cases).

Still not entirely sure that will help stufficiently though. Since we
are sometimes relying on sorting etc, to be efficient.

e.g. if we have three definers, and we delete h from it (where h is
guaranteed to appear: )

* DONE profile the convex hull algos, since they are quite a bit slower than just sorting.

-- I'm now guessing that the _Vector iso is causing the trouble, since
that thing is potentially rebuilding a new vector (using generate)
even if we are just accessing some field. If that is indeed happening,
then that is very wasteful.

* DONE clean up the benchmarks

maybe make s.t. like prettychart; i.e have some webserver running that

input to the server.

* performance

I compared the BAPC armybase tests. It's a bit of an apples vs oranges
comparison, since I only had an old 8.10.7 build of the bapc examples
around, and I've built the new stuff using 9.6.1

anyway, the old bapc armybase testsuite took

13.65s user 0.03s system 99% cpu 13.687 total

whereas the new run took roughly

8.28s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 8.305 total

not sure what's the mian gain. Maybe most of it is simply switching to
a faster sorting algo; since we are now using vector-algorithms's
introsort rather than mergesort.

Still, it's nice that we are faster :).
