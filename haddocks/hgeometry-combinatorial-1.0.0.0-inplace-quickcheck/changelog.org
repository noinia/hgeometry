#+title: Revision history for HGeometry-Combinatorial
#+STARTUP: showeverything

* 1.0 [Unreleased]  -- YYYY-mm-dd

- Rewrite compatible with HGeometry 1.0

* 0.15 [unreleased] ; only on github

- Added ~AsA~ class so that we can write functions that accept bot a
  core-only value of type ~c~ and an ~Ext~.
- Added an ~AsExt~ class that to capture types that can be decomposed
  (and recomposed) into an ~Ext~.
- Added ~HGeometry.Number.Ratio.Generalized~ that implements Ratio but supports
  types that are not ~Integral~.
- A ~HGeometry.Number.Real.Symbolic~ type that represents numbers with a
  symbolic pertubation. Useful for Simulation of Simplicity.
- Dropped the ~CanAquire~ module.
- Explicit export list for ~Data.Permutation~.
- Added the ~HGeometry.Sign~ and ~HGeometry.Indexed~ modules.
- Support mtl 2.3
- Added ~HGeometry.Number.Radical~ for types that support computing square roots.
- Added ~HGeometry.Foldable.Sort~ which has a faster sort implementation
  (that will take any Foldable and return an Vector.)
- Added ~HGeometry.Cyclic~ and ~HGeometry.Vector.NonEmpty~ modules.
- Added Uniform and UniformRange instances for ~Ext~.
- Removed ~Data.PlanarGraph.Mutable~, ~Data.PlanarGraph.Persistent~,
  and ~Data.PlanarGraph.Immutable~, since they were note used anyway.

* 0.14

- Got rid of proxies to build planar graphs, use TypeApplication
  instead. Also slightly changed some of the types to better reflect
  what they need; in particular 'buildGraph' now takes only the
  adjacency lists (no face information). And 'fromAdjRep' which
  computes a PlanarGraph from its adjacencylists (including vertex and
  edge info.)
- Cleaning up the public API by hiding several internal modules.

* 0.13

- Moved 'intersects' from the HasIntersectionWith class into a new
  class IsIntersectableWith. This allows separate (weaker) constraints
  for checking *if* geometries intersect rather than computing exact
  intersections.
- Bug fixes in the orientations of boundaries in PlanarGraph.
- Implementation of Logaritmic Method, wich allows us to transform a
  static data structure into an insertion only data structure

* 0.12

- Add Data.Double.Approximate: Floating point numbers take take
  imprecision into account when ordering.
- Add Data.Double.Shaman: Floating point numbers that keep track of
  error bounds while not being more than an order of magnitude slower
  than native floating point numbers.
- Add Data.PlanarGraph.Immutable and Data.PlanarGraph.Mutable: New
  planargraph implementation that supports efficient updates and queries.

* 0.11

- Changed the implementation of Two and Three in Data.Util
  (hgeometry-combinatorial). Now they have proper Functor, Foldable,
  and Traversable instances.
- Added Data.RealNumber.Rational wrapping the Rational type giving
  some more readable show/read instances
- Added function to compute levels in a Rose-Tree
- Moved the binary searching functions from Data.Sequence.Util into
  Algorithms.BinarySearch, also added a version for fractional types
  that stops at a given threshold.
- Removed Data.BalBST and Data.SlowSeq
- Moved Measured from Data.BinaryTree into a separate module.

* 0.10

- More Instances

* 0.9

- First release in which hgeometry-combinatorial was split off from hgeometry.
