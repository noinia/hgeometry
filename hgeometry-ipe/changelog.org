#+STARTUP: showeverything

* Changelog

** 0.11
- Split the Types module into smaller sub modules, and restricting
  what is exported.
- Traversable, Foldable, and Functor instances for the ipe types.
- Reading and Writing of Ellipses :)
- Added Coordinate Float and IpeWriteText Float instances.
- readAll now accepts only one IpePage rather than a Foldable f => f
  (IpePage r)
- Renamed attrLens to ixAttr, and added a prism _Attr to access an
  attribute._
- added convenience functions (well, Getter's) for getting all Ipe
  objects on a particular layer, or in a particular view.
- readSinglePageFile now makes sure there is at least one layer / view
  in the file, and if not creates it. This matches the behaviour of
  ipe itself. See the new 'withDefaults' function in the Types module
  for the details.
- fromContent now creates these layers and views as well.

** 0.10

- Added a 'labeled' IpeOut that supports labeling geometric objects
  with some textual label
- IpeWrite instance for NonEmpty Lists, and IpeWriteText and
  Coordinate instances for Data.RealNumber.Rational

** 0.9

- First release in which hgeometry-ipe was split off from hgeometry.
